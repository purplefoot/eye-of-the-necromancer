77a6: Location 1:
      
77a7: Location 2:
      You are standing in a dark and<,>musty forest. The undergrowth isdeep making it hard to walk. A<,>feeling of inexplicable dread<,>pervades the atmosphere around<,>here. Not a sound can be heard, and not even the cries of birds disturb the ominous silence.<,>Dark forest paths lead east and southeast.
78ca: Location 3:
      You are standing in an open areabetween the trees. Dim forest<,>paths lead away east and west,<,>while little-used tracks head<,>off in the southerly directions.
7966: Location 4:
      You are standing in a thick partof the forest. Pushing your way through the branches you can seepaths leading away east, west<,>and several other directions to the south. A path leads out of<,>the forest into the bright<,>daylight to the north.
7a55: Location 5:
      You are standing on a low rise<,>in the forest. Trees cover most if it.Paths lead into the forestvia several directions. Light<,>gets in through the gap where<,>the trees meet far above your<,>head.
7b14: Location 6:
      You are standing in what is an<,>unnaturaly well lit area of<,>trees. The atmosphere here is<,>strange. It is as bright as fulldaylight, despite the fact that the trees block out all of the<,>natural light. The clearings to the south and northeast couldn'tprovide this much light. Paths<,>also wind away in many other<,>directions.
7c54: Location 7:
      You have entered a small<,>clearing in the forest. The areahas been cleared by fire. The<,>whole place is blackened and<,>burnt. It looks as if the<,>Necromancer has been using the<,>place for target practice! Pathslead back into the forest west<,>and southwest. A path leads to acliff edge northwest.
7d76: Location 8:
      You are standing in a large<,>natural clearing. Grass carpets the floor and the sun is visiblein the sky above. At the far<,>eastern end is an old cottage,<,>whick looks pretty decrepid. Youcould go north and northwest.
7e4c: Location 9:
      You are beside the cottage. It<,>is very battered and could do<,>with pulling down. The paintworkis peeling and underneath, the<,>plaster is cracked and begining to crumble. The windows are<,>broken and boarded up. Paths<,>lead behind the cottage to the<,>northeast and southeast.
7f59: Location 10:
      You are inside the old cottage.<,>It is in pretty bad shape with<,>peeling plaster and lose floor-<,>boards. Most of the thatched<,>roof lies rotting on the floor,<,>the rafters broken and hanging<,>down.
801a: Location 11:
      You are in a dark area behind<,>the cottage which is surrounded<,>by forest. There is just enough light coming through the trees<,>to see a few details. One thing that becomes clear is that the<,>floor to the east looks very<,>unsafe indeed. It doesn't look<,>solid.Try going northwest or<,>southwest.
813a: Location 12:
      You have struggled and scrambledthrough branches until you find yourself halfway up a tree. The branches poke at you from all<,>angles. It looks like you could climb a bit further without too much trouble.
8206: Location 13:
      You have climbed to the very topof a tree. You can see the<,>forest streching out for miles<,>around, and beyond that a range of snow capped mountains are<,>visible. Pretty, isn't it? The<,>most prominent object in your<,>field of vision is the castle.<,>It's towers and spires rise<,>above the trees and cast dark<,>shadows.
833c: Location 14:
      You are standing at the edge of a high cliff. Across from<,>you is the castle. Its black<,>bulk blocks out most of the<,>sunlight. The drawbridge, made<,>of solid wood, is raised. On<,>the blank wooden wall facing youa stark notice has been nailed. In bold black print, it states :      SHOUT FOR ATTENDANT<,>Paths lead back into the forest south, southeast and southwest.
84a5: Location 15:
      You are in a small,smooth cave<,>at the bottom of an incredibly<,>long shaft. Looking up, you can just see light, but it is faint.There is an entrance to the cavenorth, through which light<,>streams.
8567: Location 16:
      You are standing north of the<,>entrance to a dark cave in the<,>cliff. You are appear to be in<,>some sort of quarry that has<,>been excavated out of the<,>limestone. It must be a mile<,>deep, if it's an inch. In the<,>centre of the quarry stands a<,>huge needle of rock, inserted<,>point down into the ground. You are standing just to the south<,>of it. Rarely trodden paths leadround the rock, heading both<,>northeast and northwest.
8706: Location 17:
      You are standing at the west<,>side of the needle of rock.<,>Touching the rock here reveals<,>that every so often a shudder<,>shakes through the whole rock,<,>and pebbles clatter down from<,>above. Something is definitely<,>going on. Paths northeast and<,>southeast.
8801: Location 18:
      You are standing to the north ofthe needle of rock. Someone has attacked this side with a rock<,>breaking crew, by the looks of<,>things. Paths lead southeast andsouthwest.
88aa: Location 19:
      You are standing to the east of the needle of rock. Here it is<,>obvious the the force required<,>to drive the great rock into theground was huge. The area is<,>covered with hairline cracks,<,>from which steam escapes from<,>time to time. The path goes<,>northwest and southwest.
89b6: Location 20:
      You are in the overflow cave of the castle sewage system. A bentmetal grate in the ceiling is<,>the exit. The only other way<,>seems to be west along..(dare I even suggest it) a disgusting,<,>horrible, slimy, smelly sewer<,>tunnel.
8a96: Location 21:
      You are standing in a dark sewertunnel. The smell is close to<,>intolerable, and what you're<,>standing in doesn't bear even<,>thinking about. The tunnel leadswest, but a slightly cleaner<,>cave is to the east.
8b61: Location 22:
      You are in a long cramped sewer tunnel running east to west. Thewalls are covered in horrible<,>slimy stuff, and the floor is<,>wet, making it hard to find a<,>footing. The smell is getting<,>worse and you nearly tripped<,>over a loose flagstone.
8c4e: Location 23:
      You are crawling through a sewertunnel. You are up to your<,>elbows in untreated sewage. Not the nicest place to be. The<,>tunnel leads back east, wideningsomewhat. But, oh joy of joys,<,>to the west the tunnel leads outinto a small room.
8d37: Location 24:
      You are standing in a small roomcarved out of the rock. The<,>floor is free from gunge, and<,>the walls and ceiling are dry.A very small sewer tunnel enters<,>through a hole in the east wall.
8df1: Location 25:
      You are in a maze of twisty<,>sewer tunnels with exits in all directions.<,><,>Irritating, isn't it?
8e50: Location 26:
      You are in a maze of twisty<,>sewer tunnels with exits in all directions.<,><,>Irritating, isn't it?
8eaf: Location 27:

8f0e: Location 28:
      You are in a maze of twisty<,>sewer tunnels with exits is all directions.<,><,>Irritating, isn't it?
8f6d: Location 29:
      You are in a room decorated in<,>a tasteless shade of orange.<,>There are only a few important<,>features in this room. One is<,>the sewer tunnel which enters<,>the room southeast. For the<,>others, you'll have to read the object list. So there!
9057: Location 30:
      You are standing in a plush<,>executive elevator. The floor isthickly carpeted, and there is amirror on one wall. After you'vefinished admiring yourself, you also notice the doors to the<,>north are open, revealing a<,>flight of stone steps, shrouded in mist.
