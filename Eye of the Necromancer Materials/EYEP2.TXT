8195: Location 31:
      You are standing at the base of a flight of stone steps that<,>rise up to the north. A thick<,>mist floats down the rough-hewn steps and collects at the base<,>around your feet. Behind you a<,>pair of sliding doors lead to anelevator.Or at least they would,if they were open.
82a1: Location 32:
      You are in a large chamber<,>shaped like a five-pointed star.The ceiling is high, the walls<,>sloping inward to form a point, directly above the centre of thechamber. Each point of the star leads to a passageway of some<,>sort. You see that you can go<,>south,east,west,northeast and<,>northwest. There is also an exitvia a carved archway in the<,>northern wall, at the base of<,>the northeast and northwest<,>points of the star.
843f: Location 33:
      You are standing in a very<,>strange room indeed. The walls, ceiling and floor are made<,>entirely of glass, through whichstrange kaleidescopic images canbe seen. There is an archway<,>south, while to the north is a<,>stone passage, illuminated by a strange red glow.
8543: Location 34:
      You are standing on the shore ofa lake. A lake of fire. The<,>surface is covered with flames. The heat is almost unbearable.<,>The cave containing the lake<,>goes much further than your eye can see. The ceiling is low, andin places flames lick at the<,>stalactites. No paths around thelake can be seen, and the<,>passage to the south collapsed<,>as you entered.
86a1: Location 35:
      You are standing in a bare<,>office area. There is no<,>furniture, but there are signs<,>that a desk was once present. A sign on the wall proclaims the<,>place as the offices of:<,>'The ACME Golden Egg Co.'.<,>There are some steps down to:<,>'THE COLLECTION AREA'.<,>A passage leads southeast. Thereis another exit west.
87d2: Location 36:
      You are standing in the chicken batteries. The corridor you are standing in is walled with smallcramped wire cages. A passage<,>leads into an office northwest. There is a large room east.
888c: Location 37:
      You are standing in a large roomwith metal walls. A huge bird<,>cage stands in one corner, its<,>steel bars bent apart. The only clue is a sign hanging above thecage which reads:<,>       'Norwegian Blue.<,>      (Pythonicus Humorous)'<,>Passages lead east and west to<,>the chicken batteries.
89a6: Location 38:
      You are in a small ante-room. Ithas been wallpapered, very badlyindeed. There is damp creeping<,>up the walls as well. A doorway leads west into what looks like a metal room. There is an<,>archway in the southeast corner leading out to a courtyard.

8aa6: Location 50:
      You are standing at the bottom<,>of a short flight of stairs<,>which appear to lead up to some sort of office area. Down here, however, it is dark and smelly. You can just make out an open<,>area southeast, from which<,>clucking noises can be heard.
8b98: Location 51:
      You are standing below the<,>chicken batteries. Rows of cageshang above you, with a walkway<,>running through the centre. Mostare empty but a few of them<,>still contain birds.The floor iswhite with dung and feathers,<,>which drop from above. You can<,>go northwest.

8ca3: Location 62:
      
8ca4: Location 63:
      You are standing in a smooth<,>corridor, running east to west. The passage leads off into a<,>large chamber east,while to the west it splits into two. You<,>have a choice of northwest and<,>southwest.
8d65: Location 64:
      You are standing in a square<,>room. The walls are made of<,>asbestos for some reason.Lookingaround, you find one. A sign<,>states that this is the:<,>   'FIRE PREVENTION ROOM'.<,>Corridors lead out of the room<,>northeast and east.
8e42: Location 65:
      You are standing in the armoury.Suits of armour in glass cases<,>line the walls. Some are ornate,pieces of superb craftmanship,<,>others merely functional.Swords,polearms, bows and other such<,>instruments of death cover the<,>high walls. There is a passage<,>leading west.
8f4a: Location 66:
      You are standing in a square<,>room with walls and a floor madeof wood. All the wood has been<,>varnished and polished until it almost reflects as well as a<,>mirror. Passages lead north,<,>south and west.
9010: Location 67:
      Weeee! Wehey!! Woops!! Weee.....Ah,sorry about that, got a bit<,>carried away. Why ? Well...<,>You are standing (or bouncing), on a giant inflated bag, like<,>something from a fairground.<,>There is a passageway east.<,>Bounce,bounce!! Fun, isn't it!
9101: Location 68:
      You are standing in a granite<,>corridor. The standard of the<,>workmanship here is very low<,>indeed. Set into the east wall<,>is a barred window. The corridorexits to the south and continueson north. Rumbling noises can beheard from that direction.
91f4: Location 69:
      You are standing in a very largecave. Black clouds swirl around you with great menace. Lightninglashes out violently, and a clapof thunder swiftly follows. The place is alive with electricity.You are in The Storm Room. More lightning strikes near you.<,>There is an exit from the room<,>south.
9316: Location 70:
      You are standing in a very odd<,>corridor. The northern end is<,>constructed of polished wood,<,>while to the south the passage<,>walls are ordinary bricks and<,>mortar. Very interesting....but stupid! Anyway, the south end ofthe corridor leads out into a<,>street.
9414: Location 71:
      By the look of things, there is a town somewhere that is missingpart of it's high street. The<,>only building that has been<,>borrowed is on the east side of the street. A sign proclaims it as:'Yalcrabs Bank'. Its doors<,>are open(On a Saturday!!). Thereis a corridor to the north and<,>the street ends in a dead end tothe south.
9556: Location 72:
      You are standing inside a branchof Yalcrab's Bank. The place is a mess. Bits of furniture are<,>scattered everywhere. Most of<,>the advertising displays have<,>been torn to pieces. It looks<,>like evidence of a riot. You cango northeast through a gap in<,>serving counter, and the street is west.
9675: Location 73:
      You are behind the counter in<,>the bank. The damage from the<,>riot is very bad back here. The cashiers draws have been rifled,and all the money is gone. The<,>gap in the counter is southwest,and appears to be the only exit.
9751: Location 74:
      You are standing inside a huge<,>walk-in bank vault. The walls<,>are covered with metal safety(!)deposit boxes. They all been<,>forced open, with a crowbar-likeinstument. There is a giant<,>metal door to the west.It standsopen.
982d: Location 75:
      You are at a dead end. A sectionof town street leads off to the north. A flight of stone steps<,>leads down through a hole in thefloor. There isn't much more I<,>can say about this place, so I<,>won't say anything.
98fe: Location 76:
      You are standing in the centre<,>of a large wine cellar. The air is thick with the musty smell ofalcohol. The walls are covered<,>with wine racks, all of which<,>are empty. The only exit is up<,>a flight of stairs to a hole in the ceiling.
99e6: Location 77:
      You are standing in a corridor<,>that does odd things to your<,>eyes. It appears to be a normal household corridor, with white<,>skirting-boards, flock wallpaperand an artex ceiling. But, as itheads northwest, it expands,bothhorizontally and vertically,<,>until the door at the end is<,>fully 30 feet wide by 100 feet<,>high. There is a small exit to<,>the southeast and a ten foot<,>mouse hole west.
9b67: Location 78:
      You are standing in the<,>northwest corner of a giant<,>kitchen. In the western wall themassive shape of a door looms<,>above you. The door appears to<,>be made of oak, the size of the tree it came from doesn't bear<,>imagining. The door is closed,<,>and the judging by the size of<,>it, it's going to stay that way.
9c96: Location 79:
      You are in the northeast corner of a giant kitchen.
9cca: Location 80:
      You are standing in the<,>southwest corner of a giant<,>kitchen.
9d07: Location 81:
      You are standing in what appearsto be the southeast corner of a truly enormous kitchen. It wouldseem that everything is ten<,>times its normal size. There is a huge kitchen table in the<,>centre of the room and it looks like you could climb up one of<,>the legs.
9e08: Location 82:
      You are standing in what appearsto be a giant larder. The way<,>out is east, by crawling under<,>the huge door.There are shelves above you, cluttered with jars, bottles, and many other such<,>containers. But even the lowest of these is beyond your reach.
9f01: Location 83:
      You are standing a high shelf ina giant larder. You are in the<,>midst of a good dozen jars of<,>various preserves of one kind oranother. The size of the chunks in the marmalade is beyond<,>belief! The only way down is viaa ladder.
9fe3: Location 84:
      You are on a vast expanse of<,>table in a giant kitchen. It<,>must be the size of a football<,>pitch, at least.You could slide down one of the table legs, or<,>you might be able to shin up theside of the tin of treacle you<,>are standing by.
a0cb: Location 85:
      You are standing on the rim of agiant tin of treacle. You find<,>that your footing is solid, if alittle sticky. You can clamber<,>down the side of the tin, or onejump will take you boldly were<,>no sentient being has gone<,>before. And it might even get<,>you 8.9 for technical merit.
a1de: Location 86:
      You are swimming in treacle.<,>There isn't really much more I<,>can say, is there?

a22f: Location 89:
      
a230: Location 90:
      You appear to be standing in<,>some kind of ice cavern. The<,>walls and ceiling are covered ina thick layer of ice. The floor is very slippery.The cavern runssoutheast to northwest.
a2e2: Location 91:
      The ice cavern ends here in a<,>dead end. You find yourself<,>facing a blank, featureless ice wall. The cavern winds away backto the southeast.
a36e: Location 92:
      You are standing at a junction<,>of passages. The corridors are<,>all constructed of red bricks.<,>You can go north, east and west.There is a hole in the southern wall, from which emanates a<,>draught of cold air.
a43c: Location 93:
      You are standing on the bank of a river. It flows from an entry point in the north wall of the<,>cave to a similar hole in the<,>southern wall. The flow is quitefast, and swimming could be a<,>bit dangerous unless you are a<,>strong swimmer. A passage leads back east.
a541: Location 94:
      You are standing on a sandbank<,>in the middle of a river. You<,>don't feel too safe, as the bankisn't that big, and the river<,>flows past at quite a rate. It'sa short, if dangerous swim back to the shore.
a60a: Location 95:
      You are in a brick passage that ends in a wall to the north.<,>The corridor is quite well<,>constructed, but must be pretty old, as here and there, bricks<,>are starting to disintegrate.<,>There is also writing on the<,>walls. You can go south.
a6f5: Location 96:
      You are at a dead end. So dead<,>in fact, that all my literary<,>inspiration has died with it,<,>and I can't think of anything tosay except:The only way back is through a hole in the south<,>wall.

a7b8: Location 103:
      You are standing on what was<,>once an inflated bouncy airbag.<,>A gaping hole has been torn in<,>it, causing it to lose most of<,>its volume. Well, that spoiled<,>all the fun, didn't it? The onlyother details of the room are<,>much more mundain. They include a couple of exits leading north and east.

a8ea: Location 120:
      You walk along the corridor,<,>only to be confronted with a<,>solid brick wall blocking the<,>corridor where it should carry<,>on running northeast. A large<,>sign on the wall reads:<,>       CORRIDOR CLOSED<,>         DUE TO GAME<,>        REDEVELOPMENT<,>   S.C.L apologize for any<,>    inconvenience caused.<,>The corridor leads back to the<,>southwest.
aa38: Location 121:
      You are standing in the empty<,>memory of the spectrum. There isan exit southwest, and a sign onthe wall says:<,><,>   <INVERSE>Well, that was a waste of</INVERSE><,>   <INVERSE>a hand grenade,wasn't it!</INVERSE>
