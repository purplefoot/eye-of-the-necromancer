      You are in the northwest corner<,>of an ornate courtyard.The wallsrise high above you, and a smallpatch of sky is just visible. A passage leads northwest through a carved arch. There is another,plainer archway in the northern wall.
84c0: Location 40:
      You are standing in the<,>northeast corner of an ornate<,>courtyard. There is an archway<,>in the east wall. It is very<,>elaborately carved with many<,>different scenes from great<,>histories. All very pretentious,if you ask me. Anyway, beyond<,>the arch, a flight of spiral<,>stairs is visible.
85d9: Location 41:
      You are standing in the<,>southwest corner of an ornate<,>courtyard. The flagstones here<,>could really do with a bit of<,>attention.*<,><,>*This last statement is in no<,> way intended to give a hint. It is purely for atmosphere.<,> Thank You.
86be: Location 42:
      You are standing in the<,>southeast corner of an ornate<,>courtyard. The only feature in<,>this corner of the courtyard is the poster stuck on the south<,>wall. It reads:'Machines out!<,>Leave the thinking to us!<,>Support the A.U.P.S.L.O.T.P'

87aa: Location 47:
      You are standing inside the<,>spaceship. The walls are coveredwith flashing indicator lights<,>and computer screens. In one<,>corner there is an alien,sittingin some form of chair. It is<,>hunched over a video screen,<,>attacking the controls with all five arms. It is playing 'Human Invaders'. There is an open<,>hatch south.
88e5: Location 48:
      You are standing at the base of a flight of marble stairs. The<,>steps lead up to a tower of somekind. The steps are well made,<,>carved out of shiny marble. Veryextravagant for a flight of<,>stairs, but if you can afford<,>it... There is a carved archway in the west wall, through which an open courtyard is visible.
8a1b: Location 49:
      You are standing on the castle<,>battlements, overlooking the<,>forest.They are constructed withjet black marble blocks.The viewfrom up here is tremendous. You see the great forest streching<,>out into the distance, and,<,>beyond that, the glittering<,>waters of the gulf of Erdi, and other such irritating bits of<,>metaphysics.

8b5a: Location 51:
      
8b5b: Location 52:
      You are standing in a harbour onthe shore of a huge inland sea. It streches out as far as the<,>eye can see. The salt water lapsquietly at the stone walls of<,>the harbour.A stone jetty winds off to the north. A road winds<,>away east entering a cave in thehillside.
8c60: Location 53:
      You are standing at a junction<,>of two corridors. The walls are covered with beautiful frescos. They show scenes from the TrojanWar. Unfortunately, some vandal<,>has scrawled graffitti all over<,>them. The corridor runs from<,>east to west.
8d4a: Location 54:
      You are standing in an old<,>library. The walls are covered<,>with shelves, all weighed down<,>with old grimores. The dust is<,>thick, and it is obvious that<,>many of the volumes haven't beenread for years. There is an exitthrough a door in the north<,>wall. The library opens out intoanother room east.
8e6f: Location 55:
      You are in an octaganaly shaped room. The east wall is taken up with a large viewing window,<,>which is open. There is a stone pillar in the very centre of theroom,and the walls are decoratedwith murals of various famous<,>mountaineering exploits.
8f63: Location 56:
      You are in a cafeteria. The<,>floor is tiled and is so clean<,>you could eat off it. This<,>shouldn't be nessecary, however,as there are plenty of tables.<,>They are arranged in neat rows, and all have four chairs.<,>A serving counter runs along thenorth wall, and the kitchen is<,>visible behind it. There is a<,>gap in the counter northeast. A passage leaves the room west,<,>while it also continues east.
90eb: Location 57:
      You are standing in the kitchen.Everywhere is very clean. There are large pieces of cooking<,>equipment all over the place.<,>Big stoves, ovens and fridges*<,>take up lots of room. There is<,>no food to be found anywhere,<,>however. There is a gap in the<,>serving counter southwest.<,>*It is to be pointed out that<,> these fridges, though large,<,> bear no relation whatsoever to  a certain Mr. William Perry of  the Chicago Bears football<,> team. Thank you.
92a5: Location 58:
      You are standing at the end of<,>a solid stone jetty. The inland sea streches out beyond your<,>vision. The jetty leads back to the harbour south. Moored on theeastern side of the jetty is a<,>medium sized galleon. It looks<,>deserted. The galleon can be<,>reached by means of a gangplank to the east.
93c9: Location 59:
      You are standing on the deck of a Tudor galleon. The mast rises from the deck and pierces the<,>sky like a needle (Phew! That<,>was poetic!). There is an open<,>doorway to the north leading to the stern cabins. A gangplank<,>leads off the ship to a jetty<,>west.The whole ship is strangelydeserted.
94ea: Location 60:
      You are standing in a well<,>furnished cabin at the stern of the ship. Judging by the qualityof the furnishings, it in all<,>probability belongs to the<,>captain. The place is hung with silks of various shades, and thecushions are covered in velvet.<,>There is an open door leading<,>out onto the deck south.
9615: Location 61:
      You are standing in the ships<,>locker. The walls are made of<,>planks. There are a few empty<,>shelves, most of them gathering<,>dust. It is very cramped. Why<,>you should want to come in here is quite beyond me.
96e1: Location 62:
      You are dangling on the end of arope which is hanging from a<,>window some twenty feet above<,>you. All you can see besides themile long drop below you is a<,>blank cliff face.

      You are standing by a pile of<,>huge sandstone blocks. At one<,>time they must have formed some sort of building, but now they<,>resemble a rockery. They stick<,>out of the sand at odd angles,<,>most of them partially buried.<,>There are no obvious pathways<,>leading away into the desert,<,>just a vast exapanse of<,>trackless sand.
98e0: Location 88:
      You are standing in a completelyfeatureless expanse of desert.<,>The sea of sand streches for<,>miles, further than the horizon in all directions. There is onlyone feature that grabs your<,>attention, however. That is a<,>small pile of rubble some way tothe north. It appears to be a<,>ruin of some kind.
9a07: Location 89:
      You are standing in a jet black room. Not just black, but BLACK.Yep, spell it. B L A C K. This<,>room is so black, it isn't even dark black. It is <PAPER=7><INK=0>BLACK<PAPER=0><INK=7>. This<,>place makes black look white.<,>Unfortunately, apart from being black(yes BLACK), there isn't<,>a lot else you can say about it.Oh, and it's black.

9b83: Location 97:
      You are in a bare room. There isno furniture at all. The walls<,>haven't been decorated, and the bricks are visible. It appears<,>that the whole place is made of fire bricks. Walls, floor and<,>ceiling are all a reddish-brown colour. A passageway leads west,while another goes northeast.<,>There is a definate increase in temperature in that direction.
9cdc: Location 98:
      You have entered a chamber that is constructed entirely from<,>fire bricks. The room is of a<,>circular shape, about forty feetin diameter. The walls rise up, meeting to form a cone shaped<,>roof. The place is tremendously hot. There are passages running southwest, east,south and north.Most of the heat seems to<,>emanate from the northern<,>passage.
9e32: Location 99:
      The reason for the heat here is obvious. You are standing in a<,>cave carved out of igneous rock.In the centre of the cave is a<,>lava pit. The heat is intense.<,>The lava bubbles and boils, and every so often spits globs of<,>molten rock into the air. The<,>walls of the cave are covered<,>with strange flowing formations of rock, from times when the pithas overflowed. A passage leads to a cooler area south.
9fc1: Location 100:
      You are standing in a deserted<,>blacksmiths forge. Various kindsof equipment used for shaping<,>metal hang on the walls. In the distance there is the sound of<,>air being pumped into the forge by bellows. The fire is burning high, but the heat in here is nocomparison to the redbrick<,>chamber you have just left. Thatroom is to the north.
a10e: Location 101:
      You are falling through the air at high speed, heading toward<,>certain doom !!!!!!
a160: Location 102:
      You are standing on a balcony<,>overlooking the forest. From<,>here you can see the clearing<,>with the old cottage, and other such landmarks of your travels. The balcony itself is elegantly carved, and is more decorationalthan practical. There is a dark room to the north.
a26c: Location 103:
      
a26d: Location 104:
      You are standing in a cave<,>carved out of igneous rock. In<,>the centre of the cave is a lavapit. It is completely solid, as if the lava had stopped flowing and it had cooled. The cave is<,>covered with strange flowing<,>formations of rock, from times<,>when the pit had overflowed. A<,>passage leads south.

      You are standing in what appearsto be the treasure chamber of anEgyptian tomb. Appears to be, asthere isn't any treasure any to be found. The place has been<,>looted long ago, and only a few broken pots remain, along with<,>some reeds. The walls show many paintings, depecting the great<,>burial processions of the old<,>Pharaohs. A flight of steps leadup into daylight.
a689: Location 113:
      You are standing in the burial<,>chamber of the tomb. It is aboutfifteen feet square, the ceilingonly seven feet from the floor. The walls are covered in white<,>plaster which has been shaped<,>into various drawings, along<,>with thousands of hieroglyphics.An open doorway leads out into<,>the treasure chamber to the<,>south.
a7c4: Location 114:
      You are standing at a junction<,>of three corridors. To the west,a passageway leads back into a<,>cafateria. To the south, a long corridor leads out into distant daylight. While to the north thepassage curves away westwards,<,>and there is a definate increasein temperature.
